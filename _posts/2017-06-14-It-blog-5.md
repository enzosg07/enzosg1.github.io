In today's lesson we Changed it up a bit instead of doing codecademy we talked about something different. We were asked at the beginning how do you make a cup of tea. We gave our answers to making a cup of tea but we were not thinking deep enough. No one specified the amount of water you pour into the teapot or the amount you put in the kettle. This is related to coding in the way that you need to think really deep and break up the problem to be able to solve it. We were also asked how would you describe making a cup of tea to a robot, you have to be really precise in what to tell it to do otherwise it will all go wrong.

I think it was a really productive lesson and I took away a lot from it. It was really helpful and made me think a lot.
