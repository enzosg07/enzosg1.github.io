Year 9 IT 2

To begin the lesson we were tasked with to go into our stock sheet and add a certain code to every item so it more or less corresponded with the product and work out how much it costs to make a certain item, for example pair of jordans, which is what i did. We made a new column called "code" and another one called “Cost Price.” Then we deleted what we still had in our sale price column and entered a new number into our cost price column. We then made a number into a different block on the spreadsheet. This number goes from 0 to 100% and will be how much profit you will have set ourself to make, for example, 20% is what we did in our lesson. Then we went and entered this into each of our sale price blocks. We then created an separate price using the Vlookup command and a box of code on the order form where you can choose what you would like to order. Todays lesson was tough like usual and i did not understand everything as i ended up needing a fair amount of help. I had to try and try which i struggle at but eventually I got it right. Some help from Mr Keen in the process made it go a little quicker.
